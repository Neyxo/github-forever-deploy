# github-forever-deploy
This repository contains my server deploy script, for automatic deployment of GitHub Repositories.

##When does it trigger
Currently it does execute on each "Release"-Event from GitHub. However, it is easy to change this behaviour.

##How to use it
To use it, you must paste your customized deploy script inside the root folder as deploy.sh.
As soon as everything is customized whith your own paths and settings, you can start the script by execute start.sh.
